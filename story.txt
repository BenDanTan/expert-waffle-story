"What do you think you're doing chef?" Gordan Ramsey screams at you.
"You think you can be a master chef by making me a waffle!?"
"I... I just asked if I could use a waffle iron sir." You stammer, feeling your eyes well up with tears.
"Well, Jimmy, I think you should figure something else out if you want to stand a chance!"
You look down at your waffle batter,
"I'm making you a waffle sir, now where do you keep your waffle irons?"
"You're pathetic!" screamed Ramsey. "Go get one from the back, I don't want to look at you anymore."
You make your way to the back of the kitchen and you grab the waffle iron.
