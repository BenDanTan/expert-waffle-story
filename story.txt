"What do you think you're doing chef?" Gordan Ramsey screams at you.
"You think you can be a master chef by making me a waffle!?"
"I... I just asked if I could use a waffle iron sir." You stammer, feeling your eyes well up with tears.
"Well, Jimmy, I think you should figure something else out if you want to stand a chance!"
You look down at your waffle batter,
"I'm making you a waffle sir, now where do you keep your waffle irons?"
"You're pathetic!" screamed Ramsey. "Go get one from the back, I don't want to look at you anymore."
You make your way to the back of the kitchen and you grab the waffle iron.

"You're hopeless. How did you even get on this show?" Shouts Gordon in a fit of rage.
"Get out of here, you're done."
You stare in shock. You knew that Gordon was rude, but he hasn't even give you a chance.
"Sir?"
"OUT! NOW!" Shouts Ramsey, foaming from the mouth.
Your saddness turns to cold, calculated rage.
"So be it."
With one fell swoop, the waffle iron is covered with red, and Ramsey is no more.
